# biodiv-data-lake

Experiments with a local biodiversity & bibliographic **data lake**: keep big
public datasets (OpenCitations, GBIF, Catalogue of Life, BOLD, BHL, …) as
Parquet on local disk and query them — and join across them — with **DuckDB**,
without standing up a server or converting everything to RDF.

The architecture rationale (why DuckDB + Parquet, Hive partitioning, the
medallion/views approach to schema reconciliation) is written up in
[`local-data-lake-notes.md`](local-data-lake-notes.md). This README tracks
**where we are and what's next**.

## Approach in one paragraph

Storage is decoupled from the engine: each dataset is a folder of Parquet files
(schema-on-read, query-in-place). A thin, version-controlled catalog of **views**
([`views.sql`](views.sql)) maps the raw, messy column names into clean canonical
ones — so you query `works.doi`, not a regex over a packed identifier string.
Raw data is never mutated (Bronze); views do lazy per-source reconciliation
(Silver); a small set of curated/precomputed tables can be materialised when a
query is too slow to run live (Gold).

## Repo layout

```
biodiv-data-lake/
├── README.md                  <- you are here
├── local-data-lake-notes.md   <- architecture decisions / design notes
├── views.sql                  <- adapter views (the lake "catalog")
├── lake.duckdb                <- DuckDB catalog file (gitignored; rebuild from views.sql)
└── opencitations/             <- first dataset (see opencitations/README.md)
    ├── README.md              <- how the Parquet was built + example queries
    ├── figsharefiles.sh       <- parallel downloader for the 165 Index zips
    ├── figsharefiles.txt      <- source file-id list
    ├── build_parquet.sh       <- Index zips  -> opencitations.parquet
    └── build_meta_parquet.sh  <- Meta tarball -> opencitations_meta.parquet
```

Large data files (`*.parquet`, `*.tar.gz`, `*.zip`, `lake.duckdb`, logs) are
**gitignored** — they live in the working tree but are too big for GitHub and are
fully reproducible from the scripts above.

## Status

| Dataset | State | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **OpenCitations Index** (citations) | ✅ ingested | `opencitations/opencitations.parquet` — 2,315,872,191 rows, 38 GB |
| **OpenCitations Meta** (works) | ✅ ingested | `opencitations/opencitations_meta.parquet` — 122,191,271 rows, 11 GB |
| Adapter views | ✅ `works`, `citations`, `citations_resolved` | clean columns incl. first-class `doi`/`omid` |
| Precomputed stats | ✅ `work_stats` (101M), `doi_omid` (108M) | per-work in/out degree + DOI→OMID map; instant counts |
| Sorted works | ✅ `works` (by doi), `works_by_omid` | record lookup by DOI **or** OMID in ~55 ms (was 19 s) |
| Query macros | ✅ `citation_count()`, `work_by_doi()`, `work_by_omid()`, `cited_by()`, `cites()`, `related()` | see opencitations/README.md |
| Catalogue of Life | ⬜ source identified | ColDP export (see Sources) |
| GBIF | ⬜ planned | predicate/SQL download, then re-partition Hive-style |
| BOLD, BHL | ⬜ planned | |

## Querying the lake

Always run DuckDB **from the repo root** (view paths are relative). The catalog
view definitions live in `views.sql`; (re)load them into `lake.duckdb` with:

```sh
cd /Volumes/Acer/biodiv-data-lake
duckdb lake.duckdb -c ".read views.sql"   # rebuild views any time
duckdb lake.duckdb                         # interactive session
```

Example — the headline OpenCitations query, *how many times has a DOI been
cited*, expressed naturally against the adapter views:

```sql
SELECT w.doi, count(*) AS times_cited
FROM works w
JOIN citations c ON c.cited_omid = w.omid
WHERE w.doi = '10.1016/j.ajog.2011.08.004'   -- DOIs stored lowercase
GROUP BY w.doi;
```

More examples (reference list / citers with titles, per-year trends,
most-cited works) are in [`opencitations/README.md`](opencitations/README.md).

## Where we're going (next)

1. **Faster DOI queries for OpenCitations.** ✅ Mostly done.
   - Counts: `work_stats` → `citation_count(doi)` and BHL batch joins in ~1–3 s.
   - Record lookup: `works`/`works_by_omid` are sorted Parquet copies, so lookup by
     DOI or OMID prunes to ~55 ms (was 19 s).
   - *Still open:* edge-LIST queries (`cited_by()`, `cites()`, co-citation,
     disruption) remain ~20 s scans of the 38 GB citations file. A citations copy
     **sorted by `cited_omid`** (and one by `citing_omid`) would prune those to
     sub-second — build when graph queries become routine.
2. **Bring in a taxonomic backbone** (GBIF taxonKey or COL IDs) as the reconciliation
   spine, then add occurrence/taxonomic datasets and map their columns onto
   **Darwin Core** via adapter views.
3. **Cross-dataset joins** — e.g. link literature (DOI) to taxa/occurrences.
